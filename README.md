# CoinkRickMortyChallenge

This is a frontend Angular challenge in which a fetch is made to
the Rick and Morty Api to get all the characters
show them in a table and
to filter them out by their name and type (species).

## Live Web App

I deployed the app using Netlify, so you can find the live web app in 
`https://rick-morty-bank-cards.netlify.app/`.

Take a look and quickly test the app!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes

- I created a module called "Material" for exporting all the Angular Material components used in the project in order to not overload the main app.module file.

- Regretfully, I couldn't build the "Login" page on time. (I estimate I can build it in 1 day more).
